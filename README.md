# Warning: Pixi is no longer maintained, was made as an experimental project. Im working into improving spagetthi code and all the messed up globals, but note that this is not a long-supported project just yet.

# Edit: Im changing all the architecture so it works good on any device. Being on college while doing this it's hard though.
